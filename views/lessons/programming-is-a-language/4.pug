  p After substiting the definitions for 'exchange' and 'opposite' into the sentence, you end up with:

  p.pretty Not for the first time, an 
    span.blue act of giving and receiving two things 
    span.blue having opposite views 
    span had broken out over 
    span.red breakfast 
    span at number four, Privet 
    span.red Drive. 

  p That's better, but the rest of the sentence still has some words you don't understand. So you go through the whole sentence and replace each expression or word with its definition until you get down to a sentence that has only words that you understand.
