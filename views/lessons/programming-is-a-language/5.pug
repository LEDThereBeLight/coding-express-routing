  p After substituting the definition for every word you don't know, you end up with a sentence you can completely understand:

  p.pretty Not for the first time, an 
    span.blue act of giving and receiving two things 
    span.blue having opposite views 
    span had broken out over 
    span.blue the first meal of the day 
    span at number four, Privet 
    span.blue Carry Along by Force. 

  p Okay, I don't think that whole process made it much easier to read either.

  p But a computer does. And that's how computers work. A hardware developer starts a computer off with a small set of words it understands and can perform, actions like addition and subtraction.

  p We as programmers teach computers new words so that we can write using language that we understand, rather than only using commands that the computer starts off knowing.

  p Computers look up and replace these new words with their definitions until they get down to basic operations they know how to perform.

  p This is great, because it means learning to program is more like learning a language than it is like learning a science. It's just a language that tells a computer what to do. Once you learn the most common words, you can get your point across, even if you don't word your sentences like a native.
